[13:27:58] (2.0) gf: To live online like this is to develop a keen sense of the ephemeral and, correspondingly, the absurd. It is broadly true that the internet never forgets. But the internet is also a bottomless pit into which fragments perpetually flow, and most are lost to oblivion, never revisited.

[13:28:21] (2.0) gf: It seems, in fact, like behavior developed during years spent at a screen — a devour-digest-excrete rhythm that keeps up with consumers’ notoriously diminishing attention spans.

In 2020, clips circulated of her in public video chats, with claims that she was egging on racists in the room.
