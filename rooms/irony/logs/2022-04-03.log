People who have used Omegle (and tinychat) for years may be familiar with this person, who posted child pornography, bestiality and other abuse videos. 

He was sentenced to 65 years in jail.

[16:32:43] (2.0) Borgus: Initially, the Portuguese developed the concept of the fetish to refer to the objects used in religious practices by West African natives.[4] The contemporary Portuguese feitiço may refer to more neutral terms such as charm, enchantment, or abracadabra, or more potentially offensive terms such as juju, witchcraft, witchery, conjuration or bewitchment.

[16:33:04] (2.0) Borgus: The concept was popularized in Europe circa 1757, when Charles de Brosses used it in comparing West African religion to the magical aspects of ancient Egyptian religion. Later, Auguste Comte employed the concept in his theory of the evolution of religion, wherein he posited fetishism as the earliest (most primitive) stage, followed by polytheism and monotheism. However, ethnography and anthropology would classify some artifacts of monotheistic religions as fetishes.

[16:33:14] (0.1) Borgus: Charles de Brosses  seems interesting
[16:33:37] (2.0) Borgus: The theory of fetishism was articulated at the end of the eighteenth century by G. W. F. Hegel in Lectures on the Philosophy of History. According to Hegel, Africans were incapable of abstract thought, their ideas and actions were governed by impulse, and therefore a fetish object could be anything that then was arbitrarily imbued with imaginary powers.[7]
